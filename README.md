Third Eye of Blind is a project invented by Kamel at ISMAI university in 2022, This project makes blind pipul live like normal ones ( like walking in the street or chatting on social media ...) with no need to use their eyes. if you use raspberry pi HW you download the project and run it and it will download and install all equipment automatically. this is just a beta version 0.0.1 you can text me in my email soltanikamel84@gmail.com
